# Problem
The City of Charlottesville Office of Economic Development publishes quarterly economic indicator data to educate potential business owners, current business owners, and citizens on the economic climate in the city.

# Team Challenge
Develop a more efficient process to help communicate key economic indicators for the City of Charlottesville in a visually appealing way that’s easily and quickly updatable?

# Background
The process of creating the dashboard can be very time intensive and isn’t necessarily an efficient use of time. Originally created as a Word document, it has been updated several times to have a more visual appeal. However, because it is limited to a printed document, there is no current ability to show longer trends, only the several past quarters. 

The economic indicators are included in the OED’s datatool, a compilation of fact sheets used to help promote Charlottesville as a business-friendly community and to share with business owners and community members.

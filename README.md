# City-of-Charlottesville
The City of Charlottesville Office of Economic Development publishes quarterly economic indicator data to educate potential business owners, current business owners, and citizens on the economic climate in the city. How might we develop a more efficient process to help communicate key economic indicators for the City of Charlottesville in a visually appealing way thatâ€™s easily and quickly updatable?
